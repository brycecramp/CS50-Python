#implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.


#Retrive user input
yelling = input("PLEASE YELL AT ME IN UPPERCASE: ")

#change and print user input to lowercase to simulate normal talking
calmDown = yelling.lower()
print(calmDown)
